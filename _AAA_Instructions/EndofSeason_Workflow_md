# End of Season MaxPreps Workflow
## Two-Phase Approach for Capturing Regular Season + Playoff Games

---

## Overview

At the end of each football season, 99% of games are complete by mid-December, but a small number of teams (primarily in GA, TX, LA, CA, CT) have playoff games extending into late December. This workflow uses a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1 (Mid-December)**: Scrape all teams to capture completed regular season games
2. **Phase 2 (Post-Christmas)**: Targeted scrape of playoff states to capture championship games

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Get 99% of season data immediately for early rankings
- ✅ Efficient targeted updates for remaining playoff games
- ✅ No re-scraping 16,000+ teams unnecessarily
- ✅ Playoff games automatically identified via `Future_Games` table

---

## Timeline Reference

**Regular Season Ends:** ~December 1-10 (most states)  
**Playoffs Continue Through:**
- Louisiana: December 12-13 (finals)
- California: December 12-13 (finals)
- Connecticut: December 13 (finals)
- Georgia: December 15-16 (finals)
- Texas: December 17-20 (finals, including 6-man)

**Recommended Workflow Dates:**
- **Phase 1:** December 10-12 (after most regular seasons end)
- **Phase 2:** December 26+ (after all playoffs complete)

---

## PHASE 1: Full Season Scrape (Mid-December)

### Timing
Run this around **December 10-12** when regular seasons are complete but before most playoff finals.

### Step 1.1: Close Any Previous Batches

```sql
-- Mark any old running batches as completed
UPDATE scraping_batches 
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE status = 'running';

-- Verify no running batches remain
SELECT * FROM scraping_batches WHERE status = 'running';
-- Should return 0 rows
```

### Step 1.2: Run Full Season Scrape

```bash
cd C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts\data_import
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
python maxpreps_scraper_db.py
```

**What happens:**
- Creates new batch (e.g., Batch 11, 12, etc.)
- Scrapes all 16,000+ teams from `HS_Team_MaxPreps` table
- Saves raw game data to `games_raw` table
- Takes 8-12 hours for full run
- **Completed games** (with scores) → will go to `HS_Scores`
- **Future games** (no scores yet) → will go to `Future_Games`

**Expected output:**
```
Starting batch 11: 16332 teams to process
[1/16332] Processing Team ID 1: https://...
✓ Saved 12 raw games for Team ID 1
[2/16332] Processing Team ID 2: https://...
...
==================================================
  SCRAPE COMPLETE. To finalize the data, run:
  EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 11;
==================================================
```

**Note the BatchID** - you'll need it for the next step!

### Step 1.3: Process the Batch

```sql
-- Use the BatchID from the Python script output
EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 11;
```

**What happens:**
- Reads all rows from `games_raw` for batch 11
- Parses team names, dates, scores
- Uses `HS_Team_Name_Alias` to standardize names
- Sorts games into three tables:
  - **HS_Scores**: Completed games (both teams recognized, scores present)
  - **Future_Games**: Scheduled games (both teams recognized, no scores)
  - **Unmatched_Games**: Games where one or both teams weren't recognized

**Expected output:**
```
Processing MaxPreps Batch: 11
✓ Matched games: 245,678
✓ Future games: 1,234
⚠ Unmatched games: 3,456
```

### Step 1.4: Check for Unmatched Games

```sql
-- View unmatched games requiring aliases
SELECT 
    RawHomeTeam,
    RawAwayTeam,
    GameDate,
    BatchID,
    Status
FROM Unmatched_Games
WHERE BatchID = 11 
  AND Status = 'pending'
ORDER BY GameDate;

-- Count by team name to prioritize
SELECT 
    RawHomeTeam,
    COUNT(*) as GameCount
FROM Unmatched_Games
WHERE BatchID = 11
GROUP BY RawHomeTeam
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### Step 1.5: Add Missing Aliases (If Needed)

If unmatched games exist, add aliases for the team names:

```sql
-- Check if team exists in HS_Team_Names
SELECT Team_Name 
FROM HS_Team_Names 
WHERE Team_Name LIKE '%[search term]%';

-- If team doesn't exist, add it first
INSERT INTO HS_Team_Names (Team_Name, State, City)
VALUES ('Proper Team Name (ST)', 'ST', 'City');

-- Add alias mapping
INSERT INTO HS_Team_Name_Alias (Alias_Name, Standardized_Name, Newspaper_Region)
VALUES 
    ('Raw MaxPreps Name', 'Proper Team Name (ST)', 'MaxPreps'),
    ('Another Raw Name', 'Another Proper Name (ST)', 'MaxPreps');

-- Re-run finalization to process newly aliased teams
EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 11;
```

**Repeat until:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Unmatched_Games WHERE BatchID = 11 AND Status = 'pending';
-- Returns 0 or acceptably low number
```

### Step 1.6: Verify Playoff Games Were Captured

This is the key check - verify future games are waiting in `Future_Games`:

```sql
-- Check for playoff games in key states
SELECT 
    FG.Date,
    FG.Home,
    FG.Visitor,
    T.State,
    FG.Source
FROM Future_Games FG
JOIN HS_Team_Names T ON (FG.Home = T.Team_Name OR FG.Visitor = T.Team_Name)
WHERE T.State IN ('GA', 'TX', 'LA', 'CA', 'CT')
  AND FG.Date >= '2024-12-10'  -- Adjust year as needed
ORDER BY FG.Date, T.State;

-- Count by state
SELECT 
    T.State,
    COUNT(*) as FuturePlayoffGames
FROM Future_Games FG
JOIN HS_Team_Names T ON (FG.Home = T.Team_Name OR FG.Visitor = T.Team_Name)
WHERE T.State IN ('GA', 'TX', 'LA', 'CA', 'CT')
  AND FG.Date >= '2024-12-10'
GROUP BY T.State
ORDER BY T.State;
```

**Expected results:**
```
State  FuturePlayoffGames
-----  ------------------
CA     40-60
CT     5-10
GA     20-30
LA     15-20
TX     60-80
```

### Step 1.7: Mark Batch as Complete

```sql
-- Mark batch 11 as completed
UPDATE scraping_batches 
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE batch_id = 11;
```

### Step 1.8: Generate Preliminary Rankings

At this point, you have 99% of the season's games. Generate rankings:

```sql
-- Calculate 2024 rankings with complete data
EXEC [dbo].[CalculateRankings]
    @LeagueType = 1,
    @BeginSeason = 2024,
    @EndSeason = 2024,
    @Week = 52,
    @MaxLoops = 2048;
```

### Step 1.9: Publish Preliminary Website

```powershell
cd C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\scripts
.\run_update_cycle.ps1
```

**What happens:**
- Generates JSON files from database
- Builds HTML pages
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Website shows 99% complete season rankings

**Add note to website:** "Rankings current through [date]. Championship games will be added after December 26."

---

## PHASE 2: Playoff Update (Post-Christmas)

### Timing
Run this around **December 26+** when all playoff games are complete.

### Step 2.1: Verify Playoff Games Are Complete

Check MaxPreps or state association websites to confirm all finals are done:
- Louisiana: Finals complete by 12/13
- California: Finals complete by 12/13
- Connecticut: Finals complete by 12/13
- Georgia: Finals complete by 12/16
- Texas: Finals complete by 12/20

### Step 2.2: Create Targeted Playoff Batch

Instead of re-scraping all 16,000+ teams, create a batch with only playoff state teams:

```sql
-- Create new playoff-only batch
DECLARE @PlayoffBatchID INT;

INSERT INTO scraping_batches (batch_name, created_date, total_teams, status)
VALUES ('MaxPreps Playoffs 2024 - Final Update', GETDATE(), 0, 'running');

SET @PlayoffBatchID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();

-- Add only teams from playoff states to this batch
INSERT INTO dbo.team_scraping_status (team_id, batch_id, status)
SELECT DISTINCT T.Team_ID, @PlayoffBatchID, 'pending'
FROM dbo.HS_Team_Names AS T
JOIN dbo.URL_ProperName_Mapping AS M ON T.Team_ID = M.Team_ID
WHERE T.State IN ('GA', 'TX', 'LA', 'CA', 'CT');

-- Update total_teams count
UPDATE scraping_batches 
SET total_teams = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_scraping_status WHERE batch_id = @PlayoffBatchID)
WHERE batch_id = @PlayoffBatchID;

-- Display the new batch ID
SELECT 
    @PlayoffBatchID AS PlayoffBatchID,
    COUNT(*) AS TeamsToScrape
FROM team_scraping_status
WHERE batch_id = @PlayoffBatchID;
```

**Expected output:**
```
PlayoffBatchID  TeamsToScrape
--------------  -------------
12              ~1,500-2,000
```

### Step 2.3: Run Targeted Playoff Scrape

```bash
cd C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts\data_import
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
python maxpreps_scraper_db.py
```

**What happens:**
- Script detects the new 'running' batch (batch 12)
- Only scrapes ~1,500-2,000 teams from playoff states
- Much faster: 2-3 hours instead of 8-12 hours
- Games that were "future" now have scores

**Expected output:**
```
Resuming existing 'running' batch with ID: 12
Starting batch 12: 1,847 teams to process
[1/1847] Processing Team ID 5001: Carrollton (GA)
✓ Saved 14 raw games for Team ID 5001
...
==================================================
  SCRAPE COMPLETE. To finalize the data, run:
  EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 12;
==================================================
```

### Step 2.4: Process Playoff Batch

```sql
-- Process the playoff batch
EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 12;
```

**What happens:**
- Games that were in `Future_Games` now have scores
- Should automatically move from `Future_Games` to `HS_Scores`
- New playoff games are added

**Important:** Verify your `FinalizeMaxPrepsData` procedure includes logic to:
1. Delete from `Future_Games` when inserting to `HS_Scores` (prevents duplicates)
2. Handle games that appear in multiple batches

### Step 2.5: Handle Unmatched Games

```sql
-- Check for unmatched playoff games
SELECT *
FROM Unmatched_Games
WHERE BatchID = 12
  AND Status = 'pending';
```

Add any needed aliases and re-run:
```sql
EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = 12;
```

### Step 2.6: Verify Playoff Games Were Updated

```sql
-- Check that playoff games now have scores
SELECT 
    S.Date,
    S.Home,
    S.Home_Score,
    S.Visitor,
    S.Visitor_Score,
    T.State,
    S.BatchID
FROM HS_Scores S
JOIN HS_Team_Names T ON S.Home = T.Team_Name
WHERE T.State IN ('GA', 'TX', 'LA', 'CA', 'CT')
  AND S.Date >= '2024-12-12'  -- Playoff dates
  AND S.BatchID = 12  -- From playoff batch
ORDER BY S.Date, T.State;

-- Check that Future_Games is now empty for past playoff dates
SELECT 
    FG.Date,
    FG.Home,
    FG.Visitor,
    T.State
FROM Future_Games FG
JOIN HS_Team_Names T ON (FG.Home = T.Team_Name OR FG.Visitor = T.Team_Name)
WHERE T.State IN ('GA', 'TX', 'LA', 'CA', 'CT')
  AND FG.Date < GETDATE()  -- Past dates should be cleared
ORDER BY FG.Date;
-- Should return 0 rows (or only games that haven't been played)
```

### Step 2.7: Mark Playoff Batch Complete

```sql
-- Close out the playoff batch
UPDATE scraping_batches 
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE batch_id = 12;

-- Verify batch status
SELECT 
    batch_id,
    batch_name,
    status,
    created_date,
    total_teams
FROM scraping_batches
WHERE batch_id IN (11, 12)
ORDER BY batch_id;
```

### Step 2.8: Recalculate Final Rankings

```sql
-- Recalculate with complete playoff results
EXEC [dbo].[CalculateRankings]
    @LeagueType = 1,
    @BeginSeason = 2024,
    @EndSeason = 2024,
    @Week = 52,
    @MaxLoops = 2048;
```

### Step 2.9: Publish Final Rankings

```powershell
cd C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\scripts
.\run_update_cycle.ps1
```

**Update website note:** "Rankings complete through [final playoff date]. All championship games included."

## Special Cases & Troubleshooting

### Issue: FinalizeMaxPrepsData Doesn't Process Games

**Symptoms:**
- Games remain in `games_raw`
- 0 games in `HS_Scores` from batch
- 0 games in `Unmatched_Games`

**Causes:**
1. Missing aliases for team names
2. Date format issues
3. Stored procedure logic error

**Solution - Manual Insert:**

```sql
-- Step 1: View raw games
SELECT 
    primary_team_name,
    opponent_name_raw,
    result_text,
    game_date,
    batch_id
FROM games_raw
WHERE batch_id = [YourBatchID]
  AND primary_team_name = '[Team Name]'
ORDER BY game_date;

-- Step 2: Manually insert games (example)
INSERT INTO HS_Scores (
    ID, Date, Season, Home, Visitor, 
    Home_Score, Visitor_Score, Neutral, 
    Source, BatchID, Date_Added
)
VALUES
(NEWID(), '2024-12-15', 2024, 
 'Home Team Standardized Name (ST)', 
 'Visitor Team Standardized Name (ST)', 
 42, 21, 0, 
 'MaxPreps Batch [X]', [BatchID], GETDATE());

-- Step 3: Mark raw games as processed (if using status column)
-- This depends on your games_raw table structure
```

### Issue: Duplicate Games After Playoff Update

**Symptoms:**
- Same game appears twice with different sources
- One from Phase 1 (as "future"), one from Phase 2 (with score)

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Find duplicates
SELECT 
    Date, Home, Visitor, 
    COUNT(*) as GameCount
FROM HS_Scores
WHERE Season = 2024
GROUP BY Date, Home, Visitor
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Delete specific duplicate (keep most recent)
DELETE FROM HS_Scores
WHERE ID IN (
    SELECT MIN(ID)
    FROM HS_Scores
    WHERE Date = '[duplicate_date]'
      AND Home = '[home_team]'
      AND Visitor = '[visitor_team]'
    GROUP BY Date, Home, Visitor
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);

-- OR use your duplicate removal procedure
EXEC dbo.RemoveDuplicateGames;
```

### Issue: New Teams in Playoff Games

**Symptoms:**
- Team not in `HS_Team_Names`
- Games go to `Unmatched_Games`

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Add new team
INSERT INTO HS_Team_Names (Team_Name, State, City)
VALUES ('New Team Name (ST)', 'ST', 'City Name');

-- Add MaxPreps alias
INSERT INTO HS_Team_Name_Alias (Alias_Name, Standardized_Name, Newspaper_Region)
VALUES ('Raw MaxPreps Name', 'New Team Name (ST)', 'MaxPreps');

-- Re-process batch
EXEC dbo.FinalizeMaxPrepsData @BatchID = [YourBatchID];
```

### Issue: Ambiguous Team Names (e.g., "Varsity Opponent")

**Symptoms:**
- MaxPreps uses placeholder name like "V Varsity Opponent"
- Can't create generic alias (ambiguous)

**Solution - Targeted Fix:**

```sql
-- Find the specific game in games_raw
SELECT 
    primary_team_name,
    opponent_name_raw,
    result_text,
    game_date,
    opponent_maxpreps_url,
    batch_id
FROM games_raw
WHERE opponent_name_raw LIKE '%Varsity%'
  AND primary_team_name = '[Your Team Name]'
  AND batch_id = [YourBatchID];

-- Manually insert with correct opponent (use MaxPreps URL to identify)
INSERT INTO HS_Scores (
    ID, Date, Season, Home, Visitor, 
    Home_Score, Visitor_Score, Neutral, 
    Source, BatchID, Date_Added
)
VALUES
(NEWID(), '[game_date]', 2024, 
 '[Home Team]', 
 '[Actual Opponent Name Based on URL]',  -- Look up from MaxPreps URL
 [home_score], [visitor_score], 0, 
 'MaxPreps Batch [X] - Manual', [BatchID], GETDATE());
```

---

## Verification Queries

### Check Season Completeness

```sql
-- Total games by month (should see December spike for playoffs)
SELECT 
    MONTH(Date) as Month,
    COUNT(*) as Games
FROM HS_Scores
WHERE Season = 2024
GROUP BY MONTH(Date)
ORDER BY MONTH(Date);

-- Games by state (verify playoff states updated)
SELECT 
    T.State,
    COUNT(*) as TotalGames,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN S.Date >= '2024-12-12' THEN 1 END) as PlayoffGames
FROM HS_Scores S
JOIN HS_Team_Names T ON (S.Home = T.Team_Name OR S.Visitor = T.Team_Name)
WHERE S.Season = 2024
GROUP BY T.State
ORDER BY T.State;
```

### Check Batch Summary

```sql
-- Summary of all batches
SELECT 
    batch_id,
    batch_name,
    created_date,
    status,
    total_teams,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_scraping_status 
     WHERE batch_id = sb.batch_id AND status = 'completed') as completed_teams,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_scraping_status 
     WHERE batch_id = sb.batch_id AND status = 'failed') as failed_teams
FROM scraping_batches sb
WHERE batch_name LIKE '%MaxPreps%2024%'
ORDER BY batch_id;
```

### Check Future_Games Status

```sql
-- Should be empty after Phase 2
SELECT 
    Date,
    Home,
    Visitor,
    Source
FROM Future_Games
WHERE Date < GETDATE()
ORDER BY Date;
-- Should return 0 rows
```

## Best Practices

### Timing
- ✅ Run Phase 1 as early as safe (~Dec 10) to get most data
- ✅ Wait until Dec 26+ for Phase 2 to avoid multiple updates
- ❌ Don't run Phase 2 too early (games still being played)

### Batch Management
- ✅ Always close previous 'running' batches before starting new ones
- ✅ Use descriptive batch names with dates
- ✅ Keep batch IDs documented for reference

### Alias Management
- ✅ Add common aliases proactively (before scraping)
- ✅ Review unmatched games after each batch
- ✅ Use MaxPreps URLs to verify correct team identity
- ❌ Don't create ambiguous generic aliases (like "Varsity Opponent")

### Data Quality
- ✅ Always verify Future_Games captured playoff matchups
- ✅ Check for duplicates after playoff updates
- ✅ Verify state-by-state game counts make sense
- ✅ Spot-check championship game scores match official results

### Website Updates
- ✅ Add note about preliminary rankings after Phase 1
- ✅ Update note to "complete" after Phase 2
- ✅ Consider highlighting state champions on homepage

# END-OF-SEASON RECOGNITION WORKFLOW
## Annual Process for Identifying and Contacting Top Teams

**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Next Execution:** December 2026 (after 2026 season)

---

## OVERVIEW

This workflow identifies high school football teams that deserve recognition for either:
1. **Top-Rated in State** - #1 Combined rating in their state for the current season
2. **Program Record** - Best season in their program's history (25+ seasons minimum)
3. **Double Recognition** - Both achievements in the same season

**Purpose:** Build relationships with top programs, generate traffic, establish authority

**Frequency:** Once per year, approximately 2-4 weeks after season ends

**Time Investment:** 
- Initial data generation: 2 hours
- Contact research: 20-40 hours (spread over weeks)
- Email outreach: 10-20 hours

---

## PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION (December, Week 1-2)

### Prerequisites
✅ 2025 season data fully imported (MaxPreps scraping complete)  
✅ Ranking calculator has processed through Week 52  
✅ All game scores imported for current season  
✅ GetLatestSeasonTeams procedure working correctly

### Step 1.1: Verify Data Completeness

Run these validation queries:

```sql
-- Check if current season data exists
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM HS_Rankings WHERE Season = 2026 AND Week = 52;

-- Verify game counts are reasonable
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HS_Scores WHERE Season = 2026;

-- Check for teams with no games (will be excluded)
SELECT Home, COUNT(*) as GameCount
FROM HS_Scores
WHERE Season = 2026
GROUP BY Home
HAVING COUNT(*) < 5;
```

**Expected Results:**
- 5,000+ teams with Week 52 ratings
- 50,000+ games for current season
- < 100 teams with insufficient games

### Step 1.2: Run Recognition Report

```sql
-- Generate the recognition report
EXEC Get_2025_Recognition_Report_FAST;
```

**Expected Performance:** 60-90 seconds  
**Expected Output:** 500-700 teams

**Review Summary:**
- Double Recognition: ~15-25 teams
- Top-Rated in State: ~40-55 teams  
- Program Record: ~450-650 teams

### Step 1.3: Export Data

Run the Python export script:

```bash
cd C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts
python export_recognition_report.py
```

**Outputs Created:**
- `Recognition_Report_2025_[timestamp].csv` - Full report
- `Recognition_2025_Double_Recognition_[timestamp].csv` - Priority targets
- `Recognition_2025_Top-Rated_in_State_[timestamp].csv` - State leaders
- `Recognition_2025_Program_Record_[timestamp].csv` - Historical bests
- `Recognition_2025_PRIORITY_[timestamp].csv` - Combined priority list
- `Email_Merge_Data_2025_[timestamp].csv` - Email template data

**Location:** `C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\recognition\2025\`

---

## PHASE 2: CONTACT RESEARCH (December-January, Ongoing)

### Priority Order
1. **Double Recognition** (15-25 teams) - IMMEDIATE
2. **Top 100 National Rank + Program Record** - HIGH PRIORITY
3. **All Top-Rated in State** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **Remaining Program Records** - BATCH PROCESS

### Step 2.1: Website Research

For each team, find their athletic website:

**Search Patterns:**
1. Google: `"[Team Name]" [City] [State] athletics`
2. Check school district website → Athletics section
3. Look for MaxPreps team page (often has website link)
4. Check NFHS Network, Hudl, or state association sites

**Common URL Patterns:**
- Public schools: `[district].org/athletics` or `[school].[district].org/athletics`
- Private schools: `[schoolname].org/athletics`
- Dedicated domains: `[teamname]athletics.com`

**Track in CSV:**
- Column: `Website_Status` → "Found", "Not Found", "Need Research"
- Column: `Website` → Full URL

### Step 2.2: Contact Information Mining

**For EACH website found, collect:**

1. **Athletic Director**
   - Name
   - Email (usually: firstname.lastname@domain or adname@domain)
   - Title

2. **Head Football Coach**
   - Name  
   - Email (usually: firstname.lastname@domain or coachname@domain)
   - Title

3. **Athletic Department Email**
   - General contact: athletics@domain or ad@domain
   - Fallback if individual emails not found

4. **Main Phone**
   - Athletic department main line
   - School main line as fallback

**Email Discovery Tips:**
- Check "Staff Directory" pages
- Look in coaching staff section
- Search athletics contact page
- Try common patterns if exact email not listed
- Use Hunter.io or similar tools to verify patterns

**Track in CSV:**

- Standard personalization

**Ongoing (Days 31+):** Remaining Program Records
- Send 25-50 per day
- Full automation via mail merge
- Monitor bounce rate

### Step 3.3: Email Platform Setup

**Recommended:** Use Mail Merge tool in Gmail, Outlook, or dedicated platform

**Setup:**
1. Import `Email_Merge_Data_2025_[timestamp].csv`
2. Map fields to template placeholders
3. Set up BCC to tracking email
4. Enable read receipts (if available)
5. Configure sending limits (stay under provider limits)

**Gmail Limits:** 500/day  
**Outlook Limits:** Varies by account type  
**Dedicated Platform:** Follow platform guidelines

### Step 3.4: Tracking Responses

**Track in CSV:**
- `Email_Sent_Date` - Date sent
- `Email_Status` - Sent, Bounced, Opened, Replied
- `Response_Notes` - Summary of any response
- `Follow_Up_Needed` - Yes/No
- `Follow_Up_Date` - When to follow up

**Response Types:**
1. **Positive Interest** - Thank you, wants more info
2. **Information Shared** - Sends photos, roster, etc.
3. **Acknowledgment** - Brief thank you, no follow-up needed
4. **No Response** - Track for potential follow-up
5. **Bounced** - Flag for contact research update

### Step 3.5: Follow-Up Protocol

**Timing:** 10-14 days after initial email

**Follow-Up Only For:**
- Double Recognition teams (all)
- Top 50 National Rank teams
- Teams that opened but didn't reply
- Teams with specific engagement history

**Follow-Up Template:**

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email recognizing [TEAM]'s exceptional 2025 season. 

[Original recognition summary - brief version]

I know how busy this time of year is, so no response necessary if you've already seen the recognition. If you'd like to share any team photos, season highlights, or roster information for us to feature, we'd be honored to add it to your program's page.

Congratulations again on an outstanding season.

Best,
David McKnight
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Recognition report takes too long (>5 minutes)

**Possible Causes:**
1. HS_Scores table has grown significantly
2. Missing indexes on temp tables
3. Database needs maintenance

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HS_Scores;  -- Should be <6M
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HS_Rankings;  -- Should be <550K

-- Rebuild indexes
ALTER INDEX ALL ON HS_Scores REBUILD;
ALTER INDEX ALL ON HS_Rankings REBUILD;

-- Update statistics
UPDATE STATISTICS HS_Scores;
UPDATE STATISTICS HS_Rankings;
```

### Issue: Teams missing from report

**Check:**
1. Do they have 25+ seasons? (Filter requirement)
2. Do they have 5+ games in current season?
3. Is their Week 52 rating calculated?

```sql
-- Verify specific team
SELECT * FROM HS_Rankings 
WHERE Home = 'Team Name (ST)' AND Season = 2025 AND Week = 52;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HS_Scores
WHERE (Home = 'Team Name (ST)' OR Visitor = 'Team Name (ST)')
  AND Season = 2025;
```

### Issue: Historical best seems wrong

**Verify manually:**
```sql
-- Check team's all-time ratings
SELECT TOP 10
    Season,
    [Combined calculation]
FROM HS_Rankings
WHERE Home = 'Team Name (ST)' AND Week = 52
ORDER BY [Combined] DESC;
```

**Common causes:**
- Game count filter excluding legitimate seasons
- Name variations in historical data
- Missing historical game data

### Issue: Email bounces

**Resolution:**
1. Verify email pattern is correct for that school
2. Try alternate contacts (dept email, phone call)
3. Check if domain changed (school website updates)
4. Flag for manual outreach via phone or website form

### Issue: Low response rate

**Improvements for next year:**
1. Send earlier in season (less off-season distraction)
2. Shorten email templates (too long = skipped)
3. Lead with specific stats in subject line
4. A/B test different subject lines
5. Send from personal email vs generic
6. Include visual (chart/badge) in email

## BEST PRACTICES

### Data Quality
- ✅ Always verify procedure runs successfully before bulk export
- ✅ Spot-check 10-15 teams manually to validate calculations
- ✅ Review state top-rated lists for obvious errors
- ✅ Compare to your public rankings pages for consistency

### Contact Research  
- ✅ Start with priority teams (double recognition) for quality time
- ✅ Save difficult-to-find contacts for later batches
- ✅ Document search process for teams with no public contacts
- ✅ Build relationships with state association contacts

### Email Campaign
- ✅ Personal tone beats formal/automated
- ✅ Specific stats beat generic praise
- ✅ Shorter emails get better responses
- ✅ One ask per email (don't request multiple things)
- ✅ Make it easy to respond (yes/no questions)

### Relationship Building
- ✅ Respond quickly to any replies
- ✅ Over-deliver on promises (add extra features they mention)
- ✅ Credit sources when using their content
- ✅ Follow up next year with past responders
- ✅ Build a "VIP list" of engaged programs

Step 1: Open Your Terminal & Activate Python Virtual Environment
Open Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt.
Navigate to your Python script folder:

cd "C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts"
Activate your Python virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate
(If using Command Prompt instead of PowerShell, use venv\Scripts\activate.bat.)
Step 2: Run the Python Script
Run the script to open the MHSAA website:


python MHSAA_WebScrapper.py
The script will launch Google Chrome and load the MHSAA Scores page.

Step 3: Manually Set Filters in the Browser
Set these filters manually:

Sport: Select Football.
Start Date: Enter the first date you want to collect.
End Date: Enter the last date you want to collect.
Level: Select Varsity.
Click the â€˜Searchâ€™ button manually.

Step 4: Resume Script & Save Varsity Scores
After applying the filters and clicking â€˜Searchâ€™, return to the terminal.
Press Enter in the terminal to resume the script.
The script will scrape the scores and prompt you:

Do you want to append to the existing CSV file (a) or overwrite it (w)? [a/w]:
Enter w (overwrite) to create a new CSV file for this session.
The script will process the data and save it in:


C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts\mhsaa_schedules.csv
Wait for the script to finish. You will see a message like:


ðŸŽ‰ Done! Wrote 1500 rows to mhsaa_schedules.csv
Step 5: Run Again for 8-Man Scores
Run the script again:

python MHSAA_WebScrapper.py
When the page opens, change the Level filter to 8-Man.
Click â€˜Searchâ€™ manually.
Return to the terminal and press Enter to resume.
This time, when prompted:

Do you want to append to the existing CSV file (a) or overwrite it (w)? [a/w]:
Enter a (append) to add 8-Man scores to the same CSV file.
Wait for the script to finish. You will see a message like:

ðŸŽ‰ Done! Wrote 2300 rows to mhsaa_schedules.csv
Step 6: Verify & Open CSV File
Go to the folder:

C:\Users\demck\OneDrive\Football_2024\static-football-rankings\python_scripts
Open mhsaa_schedules.csv in Excel or a text editor.
Confirm that both Varsity and 8-Man scores are present.
